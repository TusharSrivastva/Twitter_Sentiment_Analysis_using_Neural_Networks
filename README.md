<h1 align="center"> EDA and Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM models </h1>
<h2 align="center"> Objective </h2>

<p align="justify"> The objective of this project is to create neural network models for tweet setiment analysis. A lot of research has been conducted on feature engineering methods to get better accuracy in predictions; but not much emphasis has been given to Neural Network modeling when it comes to sentiment analysis. This project will focus on nerual network modeling rather feature engineering. The models which will be used in this project are <b>"Convolutional Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory"</b> also know as CNN-BiLSTM and <b>"Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory"</b> model commonly referred to as BiLSTM model.
